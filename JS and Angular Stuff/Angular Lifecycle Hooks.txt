Lifecycle Hooks
----------------------

ngOnChanges
This event executes every time when a value of an input control within the component has been 
changed.

ngOnInit
This event initializes after Angular first displays the data-bound properties or when the 
component has been initialized.

ngDoCheck
This event is triggered every time the change detection mechanism is triggered.

ngAfterContentInit
This lifecycle method is executed when Angular performs any content projection within the 
component views. This method executes when all the bindings of the component need to be checked 
for the first time.

ngAfterContentChecked
This lifecycle hook method executes every time the content of the component has been checked by 
the change detection mechanism of Angular.

ngAfterViewInit
This lifecycle hook method executes when the component’s view has been fully initialized.

ngAfterViewChecked
This method is called after the ngAterViewInit() method. It is executed every time the view of 
the given component has been checked by the change detection algorithm of Angular.

ngOnDestroy
This method will be executed just before Angular destroys the components.
