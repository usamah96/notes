Git and Github
----------------------------------------------

Git helps you track of your files

Initializing git to a project
Go to project folder and type in Git terminal
git init

Creates new file
touch index.html

Helps you find what is currently going on
git status

Adds the new file from working area to the staging area
git add index.html

Add each and every file in project from working to staging area
git add .

Save changes to file with time.
git commit -m "Added Commit"

git add tells the Git that you want to include the particular changes to 
a file in the next commit

If you create new file like index.html and type git status then it will say
the file index.html is untracked.
If you git add index.html, then git status will show that new file added that is 
index.html and git commit will save changes to that file

Will show all the commit with hash values
git log

Will remove the commit and get back to that commit (hard reset)
git reset --hard <hashvalue>

Will remove the commit but will not get back to it. It will just remove the 
commit and takes that file into working area (soft reset)
git reset <hashvalue>

Creating branches
git checkout -b newcategory

Changes in braches wont effect the Main branch until an unless it is combined

To switch between branches
git checkout master
git checkout newcategory

Merge branch
git checkout master
git merge newcategory

Delete a branch
git branch -d newcategory

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Github

Signup, Signin and create new repository
eg: repo name gitcourse

Copy the repo link and inside your Pc's folder in git bash terminal type
git clone <repo url>
This will create gitcourse directory in your folder and inside this folder you
can work

**Inside gitcourse folder
touch index.html
git add .
git commit -m "Added New File"

git push origin master
Will ask username and password and add index.html file to 
github repository.

Now if somebody contributes to the project and you want to get those changes to
your computer. Go inside gitcourse folder and type

git pull
This will pull the changes and also the commit. If you git log then it will also
show the commit name the user has typed when commiting

If you want to contribute to the project
Search for project
Fork It (It will make a copy of that repo into your account)
Then copy the repo link and git clone <repo url>
Make changes and
git push origin master (This will add changes to your account repo)
New pull request and Create pull request!
