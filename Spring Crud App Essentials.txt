Spring Crud App
-------------------------------------

Using DAOs (Data Access Object)

Controller -> Service -> DAO -> Database

-Create the DAO interface with its implementation and use @Autowired
for Dependeny Injection in the Controller.

-The implementation of DAO interface should be annotated with 
@Repository. @Repository is also the inherited version from @Component
like @Controller and Spring will manage and recognize the class during
the Component Scanning.

-We use Services to delegate the call to DAO(s) to get the data from the
Database. The purpose of this is that our Service use Dependency Injection
to inject DAO. The DAO can be multiple to get the data from database.
Our Controller just access the service and gets the data. The Service
acts as a Facade Design Pattern.

-Using hibvernate requires session.beginTransaction and commits everytime.
We can use @Transactional to avoid using it. Apply this on the method
of Services.
