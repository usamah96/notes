MVC
-Controller contain reference to the view

MVVM
-Model View View Model
-Instead of controller we have ViewModel
-Unlike MVC, ViewModel doesnt have reference to View
-View also doesnt contain reference to ViewModel.
-There is something in between View and ViewModel and that is the binder

MVP
-Model View Presenter
-The Presenter doesnt directly contain reference to view
-There is a view protocol in between them

MVVM and MVP both renamed the Controller and provided specific facilites in 
way of implementing it
