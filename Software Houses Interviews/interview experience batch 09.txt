what is the defference b/w unique key and prime key??
Shallow copy vs Deep copy:
Deep copy is necessary because in shallow copy, the copied object simply "points" to the pointer members of the original object, and doesn't allocate new memory for the copied object. If shallow copy is done, and the original object is deleted, the copied object would have dangling pointers left behind pointing to locations which have been deleted along with the original object.

folio3 question 1:check that the first and last digit of an integer is even. Solution:  for last digit: mod 10 ,for first digit: loop with condition (num /10 > 10)., loop body: num = num/10 , after getting both the numbers, check num MOD 2, if both are 0 then the first and last digits of the number are even.
Design a program to list down all Prime numbers before a given number.
Interface and Abstract Class
how AJAX works what are backend transfer procedures of post and other methods of PHP... What is OOP nd what is difference btw abstract class and class and interface class .. y to use interface class if u can have inheritance .. Other then that is threads per kaam kia hai ?? (to nhi kia tha).. What is Design Patterns (Dn't KNow) .. What are web services ? kaisay implement hoti hai and kia karti hai n kabhi use ki hai (best ans tht came in my mind was "yeh kia hota hai ") ... If u are mentioning any projects then u must have complete knowledge regarding tht .. One db schema question for file / folder system to store in db and then tell is it normalized or not .. and donu normalized and denormalized bana kar dikhao .. Fyp mai kia kar rahay ho ?? details batao and us ka technical architecture banao

Avanza Second Interview ..

Make a complete Queue class and all its funtions

1) Enqueue
2) Dequeue
3) Print Queue
4) isEmpty
5) isFull


- Technical interview started with:
OOP questions
1- What is OOP? Qualities of OOP?
2- if you make an object of derived class. then in which order will constructors be called ?
3- Explain public, protected, private with examples.
3- What happens if base class constructor is private? when is it needed? show example
4- What is singleton design pattern and how do you implement it? 
5- Explain static keyword when used in classes or just generally.
6- Run-time/Compile time binding ka difference aur polymorphism ka kia faida hota hai? What if you pass a pointer of base class (holding derived object) to a function as reference?

Java questions:
7- what superclass extends all classes in java?
8- Immutable variables kia hotay hain? is it possible to manipulate a value in immutable String in Java? how can you copy immutable value to mutable variable? and what is base class of String in java?
9- Explain garbage collector working. can you explicitly invoke garbage collector in Java?
10- Interface and abstract ka difference. When should you use which?

Data Structures:
11- Show BFS working
12- Singly linked list ka midpoint kese nikalain, show algo.
13- Assume you have no way to access HEAD pointer in Linked list. Then if you have a function which deletes any Link List node passed in a function, is it possible to implement it: function prototype is: void delete(node *temp) // mene kaha not possible as prev node reference is not available and will break linked list
14- Reverse a linked list with RECURSION.
15- Say you have two linked lists A and B, and they merge at some point but you don't know which. Find that node at which they merge. 
// I solved this using nested iteration in O(A*B) time. Then they asked me to do it in o(a+b) time. And then even implement it in log time.
16- If you have a array with sorted but some repeating integers such that 1 2 2 3 3 3 3 4 5 5... return only the integers which occur once. Limit is: you cannot use another array to store count of numbers (i did it using nested loops, and using vector to insert uniquely occuring numbers)

Other questions:
17- Generate this using recursion only, you may use a total of just two variables in your program: 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1 
prototype: int printpattern(int n) { }
called with printpattern(5)
18- Explain difference between POST/GET.
19- Explain HTML5.
20- How does a web service work?
21- About my HPC course, they asked me to explain threads, locks, communication between two threads, and synchronous/asynchronous comm? Also a little bit about Hadoop, OpenMPI , MPI and when to use which.
22- If a function is called in int main(), is it a synchronous or asynchronous call?

Maths/IQ
23- You have a path in shape of a triangle and a person is standing at each corner. Suppose they all start walking and each has 50% probability to walk in a particular direction (each person has two directions available to them) ... find out % probability of them colliding.
24- Person is stuck at bottom of a well and he has to climb 4 stars to get out... with each 2 climbs he falls 1 down. how many climbs will it take to get out of well?


make erd of some example 

Sort a large array of integers in O(N)?
Radix Sort .

TPS Interview Questions

OS:-
What is a thread? What is a process? Why is thread called lightweight? Why do we use thread when same thing can be done by process? Why do we use shared memory? What is context switching? What is Mutex? What is Semaphore(with types)? Examples of Mutex and semaphores? 

Networks:
Tell TCP/IP layers

Concurrent:-
What is socket? initialize socket? What are different types of Inter Process Communication? What is the best way of intra process communication

IPT:
What is REST? What is RPC? 

OOP:-
4 pillars of OOP? What is abstraction itself, don't give me ghissi pitti examples o vehicle-car-truck class?
What is Encapsulation?
Shallow copy vs Deep Copy?

Copy Constructor mein if we pass by object like this A(A x), instead of passing by reference A(A &x).... answer is k recursive scene hojata hai... pbject k andar object call, multiple time constructor call hota jaye gaa... will be infinite

Inheritance mein wohi concept k you cant call constructor of base with derived object ptr?
Pehle base constructor call hota hai ya derived? pehle kya destruct hota hai?

Program 1: A linked list which has no head ptr, now delete a particular node
Program 2: Write program for finding anagrams in a file (this cant be done by nested loop, i tried that but he caught me in a logical error)

DB:-
Normalization questions. Find the no of projects done by each employee. What is indexing. DB ki harddisk space mein farq aaye gaa if we do indexing?

Catalyst test:

Comprised of 3 sections
> oop
> database
> Java ( swing also )


Avanza asked me a question. I cant remember properly. but was some thing like this:

Considering two methods of function calling, and that both perform the same thing, which one is better? (ignore syntax and other errors)

//Function calls it self recursively
void func
{
int i=0;
while(i<10)
{ 
func();
i++;
}
}

And

//Function called inside a for loop
for(i=0;i<10;i++)
{
func();
}

Q: Which method is more efficient?

Q: tell me about yourself? 
he make him more deadly for me when he said only English. 
then 2nd question:
Q:why you want to be web developer ?
Q:rate your self as a programmer ?
Q: you have undefined length string , you have to print all possible combinations of it. make a logical function.
Q: they gave me 3 type of linked list , linear,circular,cycle he said if i call your function with this linked list ,then return with the name of the linked list type. 

There are three differences:

- Interfaces can only declare public methods (i.e. no protected or package-private visible methods) and can not declare any fields
- Subclasses can only extend at most one abstract class, but can implement any number of interfaces
- The abstract class can also have implementations for some or all of the methods

Mujhay to sab se behtar yaheen lageen. 
Not sure about Pure Abstract and Interfaces.

TPS Interview Questions (TIME: 1.75 hours) :

-How will a constructor and destructor be called of classes using inheritence. class Base{}; class D1:public base{}; class D2:public D1{};

-Which is true/false? BASE b=new D1(); ....// he did many initilizations like this for quering the correct and wrong intilizations. 

-What is difference between abstract & interface? If both classes have declarations then why is the need of interface?

-What is polymorphism?

-What is overloading and overriding? What are signature in overloading?

(and Many OOP questions that don't come to my mind right now) The interviewer on every answer cross questioned and sometime emphasized and the wrong answer to be correct, you have to be very firm giving your answers if they are correct. 

Algorithm and Coding :

-Write a function that reverses and integer: int reverse(int value)// you can't use string.

-Write a function that detects palindrom: bool isPalin(string value).

-Write a function using recursion that returns: int factorial(int fact).

Database:

-ACID Properties

-Transaction

-Normalization of a table that interviewer gave

-SQL QUERIES : -Count the number of courses, mr x is taking, - Count the number of courses each Mr x is taking.

-What is Indexing, is Insertion on table increases the time if table is indexed? 

-What happens when an update occurs on an index table?

...some more questions that don't come to my mind right now.

what is the angle between the needles(hour and min) of clock at 315?

SELECT 1 FROM Table_Name WHERE NULL=NULL
SELECT 1 FROM Table_Name WHERE NULL IS NULL

Output kya hoga


 difference between new and malloc ?
Is it possible to call a constructor from another constructor (within the same class, not from a subclass)? 

Pehle 10mins ka analytical test hoga in which they'll ask you some trick questions, like the one asked at VentureDive test. Then 10mins ka maths ka test hoga .. It would be easy, simultaneous equations wagera solve krni hoti hain 1 2 .. Then written test hoga 30mins ka related to your field !! .. And then technical interview .. He asked me to code a B+ tree in C language, Inheritance k questions thay bachon walay .. 1 query thi jis main 3 join lagne thay .. That's all I remember ..

Their technical had questions about design patterns, asked me to write a binary tree node insertion code, same old string reverse, asked me trick questions to several for loops execution, ah and there was one in my last that there is a file and 4 processes are reading it, and each write and commit 1 by 1, what would be the end result written on the file


TRG/Data analyst.

in depth statistical stuff the guy asked. normal distributions and confidence intervals, kuch yaad hi nahin tha  heck didnt even know what a random variable is. if anyone is planning to go, do probability and statistics seriously, and then give it a shot.

- Asked some mind games kinda questions that you can lookup on their website.
- Everything was abstract, if he will ask for a SQL query - you only have to explain verbally how you would do it. Take join here there, order by this that... no syntax.
- Programs will be pseudocodes. again nothing syntactical.

In a nutshell, like the interviewer himself said - this job is 70% thinking and 30% coding. and you have to be VERY strong in mathematics, probability and stats. Its a team of 15 people and there are PHDs, local and foreign masters, and bachelors. only thing common is they are extremely good in math, probability and stats.


q1 basic oop concepts
q2 reverse string
q3 join query


AoA, i was too lazy to post the question yesterday , It was a 2 hours + interview in TPS  . My interview was conduted by .net team instead of socket (C++) team so kafi tough tha ,full exhaust kr dia  
------------------start of interview ----------------------------
1) why do we use object oriented programming , i answered it and then he asked that header files me bhi to wo kaam ho sakta hai ,kaafi ghumaya us ne  
2) encapsulation ?? i answered data adding k context me bataya but he said data hiding hoti hai :S which i said k wo to abstraction hoti hai .
3)implementation of stack , private , public attributes kia kia hongai etc
4) Abstract class , benefits 
5)interface , benefits , diff between interface and abstarct class . 
6) abstract class se 3 multi level inheritence ker k 5 initialization k code likh diay , jo sahi hai us p tick kro , like base se child k pointer initialize krwaya etc 
7)output of code using x++ , and ++x 
8)overloading , and same function with same parameters me kon sa call hoga , and return type different ho to kon sa call hoga 
9)Polymorphism , benefits , implementation etc , difference bw polymorph and overloading 
10)thread level p kaam kia hai ? lol kia issue ata hai , i told dependency , kese resolve hoga?? etc etc 
-----------------then the coding part --------------
1)ek prototype likh di jis me parameter int tha and return type bhi int thi , and int ko reverse kr k int me hi bethana tha not in array and int ki length fix nahi thi , eg 123 ko 321 , i did it easily 
2)implementataion of fibonacci series ,
3)recursion , compute factorial
4)binary trees (traverse, ascending logic)
5)sorting algos (most efficiennt)
6)searching algos 
-----------------Database part -----------------
1)Views
2)stored procedures 
3)function 
4)benefits , diff ,bw them etc , kafi dimagh khaya 
5)ek table ko normalize krwaya final state me ,
6)query chalani thi count ki , on normalized table jo kia tha
7)join ki and cont ki query mila k chalani thi ek
and kuch aur questions thy , i dun remember 
----------------IQ---------------------------------
ye questions b bech bech a k tang krrahey thy bara  but 1 k ilawa baqi sab sahi kr liay 
1)3 litre bucket , 5 litre bucket , measure 4 litre of water
2)1 pan , 9 balls , same weight , 1 ball has different weight , pan can be used 2 times only , fingd out the ball that has diff weight
3) 1 room , 1 door , no window , 3 bulbs inside room , switches outside the room , can enter room 1 time only , har bulb ka switch batao :S , nahi hua ye  lol


http://stackoverflow.com/questions/979211/struct-inheritance-in-c

Okay having finally... finally... secured a job (alhamdolilah  ) and being a veteran of many screwed up interviews .. I have a bit of interview tips for the fellows who are still in search of a job...

Tip 1: Always stay confident. Always!
Tip 2: Don't go with the 'if you don't know something then say you don't know ' thats silly... If you don't know something suggest at least 3 4 alternatives that you do know of, then you can say that .. Perhaps my approach is not what you were looking for?... or basically soften the blow..
Tip 3: Try to learn as much as you can, beforehand... Not because the interviewer will cover everything .. But because it boosts up your confidence...
Tip 4: If you can't learn everything then make your strong points stronger... And try to keep the interviewer busy in that...
Tip 5: (This one is just a repetition of what Musa earlier said, thanks mate  ) The 'tell us about yourself' part... this is the time when you can steer the interview to where you want.... If your fyp was good try to steer it there...
Tip 6: chill out! Panic most certainly screws it up  TRG and TPS aise hi nikla mera dost.. Confidence remember 

That's all i guess... Inshallah everyone of the batch gets a job.. Ameen.. If I know of an opening, I will most certainly put it up here. 



4 hours at TenPearls today. Started off with a basic HR interview, then a computerized test (IQ, analytic, math, OOP, DB), followed by two technical interviews, the first by a senior developer (included questions about DB, networks, OS, OOP, data structures and logic) and the second by a project manager (mostly about OOAD and SQA).
