Abstract Class

a class which cannot be instantiated. exists purely for the reason of
 being inherited. contains methods, variables. 

a class that can be instantiated 
is called a concrete class.


Interfaces:
only define method names. no implementation. 
classes sign a contract and decide to implement the interfaces. they must implement 
all the methods of that interfacee. the use is that multiple classes can implement the 
same interface and if u know nothing about the objects u can check if that 
particular object implements that interface it has some specific function implemented.
