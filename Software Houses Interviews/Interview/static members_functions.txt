“static/shared member or class level variable:”

when a variable is shared among all 
the objects of that class. eg. interestRate of savingsAccount. every object will 
have the same interestRate thus it can be static.
variable can change but it is 
same throughout all objects.

is accessed using class name 
(SavingsAccount.interestRate). does not need object to change its 
value.


“static methods”
can only access static variables. 
SavingsAccount.setInterestRate(0.9)

static members in uml are shown with underline.
