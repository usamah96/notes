js objects, prototype, properties, methods, object vs literal, literal vs constructor notation (It essentially boils down to if you need multiple instances of your object or not; object defined with a constructor lets you have multiple instances of that object. Object literals are basically singletons with variables/methods that are all public)

function of var keyword and when to use it (
If you're in the global scope then there's no difference.
If you're in a function then var will create a local variable, "no var" will look up the scope chain until it finds the variable or hits the global scope (at which point it will create it))

__call() used for overloading in php. You can use splauto load to autoload classes

C# => We need to use virtual and override keywords to implement polymorphism as in java

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13423494/why-is-overriding-method-parameters-a-violation-of-strict-standards-in-php (Since PHP is weak typed, this is not possible to achieve, because the compiler can't know which of the methods you are actually calling. (hence the reason you can't have 2 methods with the same name, even if their signatures are different).

The fundamental difference between those two ways is that const defines constants at compile time, whereas define defines them at run time. This causes most of const's disadvantages

Q: What is a class?
A: In object-oriented programming, a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).

Q: What is OOP?
A: Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the 
concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

Q: Difference between Truncate and Delete?
A: 
* truncate is faster than delete
* delete is DML and truncate is DDL
* Delete does not recover space, Truncate recovers space
* Delete can remove only some rows. Truncate removes all rows.
* A truncate cannot be applied when an enabled foreign key references the table. Treatment with delete depends on the configuration of the foreign keys.
* Delete can be conditional whereas Truncate cannot.
