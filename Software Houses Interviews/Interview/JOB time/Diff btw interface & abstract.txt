Abstract Class :

1 - Have constructors.

2 - Not necessarily for the class inheriting it to implement all the methods.

3 - Doesn't support multiple inheritance .

4- Can have abstract as well as non abstract methods.

5- Not necessary for classes inheriting abstract class to provide definition of all the functions that exist in the abstract class.



Interface :


1 - Doesn't have constructors.

2 -Necessarily for the class inheriting it to implement all the methods.

3 - Supports multiple inheritance .

4- Can have only abstract methods.

5- Necessary for classes implementing interface to provide definition of all the functions that exist in interface.
