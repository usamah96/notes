Encapsulate hides variables or some implementation that may be changed so often in 
a class to prevent
 outsiders access it directly. They must access it via getter and setter methods.



Data encapsulation(Data hiding) is wrapping and controlling access of logically 
related data in a class. 
One of the aspect of this is by using suitable access modifiers.
By providing only setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or 
write-only.
It provides you the control over the data.




Abstraction is used to hiding something too but in a higher degree
(class, interface). Clients use
 an abstract class(or interface) do not care about who or which it was, they just 
need to know what
 it can do.

Where as Abstraction is hiding internal implementation details and expose 
only relevant details to the user. In a way you can Abstraction is achieved by 
Encapsulation.
